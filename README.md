# Voice Assistant with GPT-3

This project implements a voice assistant using OpenAI's GPT-3 for natural language processing. It includes speech recognition, text-to-speech capabilities, and the potential to control external devices (Arduino) based on recognized commands.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition:** Converts user voice input into text using the `speech_recognition` library.
- **Text-to-Speech:** Utilizes the `pyttsx3` library for converting text responses to spoken words.
- **GPT-3 Integration:** Communicates with OpenAI's GPT-3 API to generate responses based on user queries.
- **Arduino Integration:** Optional functionality to control Arduino devices based on recognized commands.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `openai` library (`pip install openai`)
- `pyttsx3` library (`pip install pyttsx3`)
- `speech_recognition` library (`pip install SpeechRecognition`)
- `webbrowser` library (usually included with Python)
- `serial` library for Arduino communication (`pip install pyserial`)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/voice-assistant.git
   cd voice-assistant
